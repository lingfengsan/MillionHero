Security Critical: no

Description:
This is a copy of the zipfile module from Python 2.7.13. This snapshot was
taken to workaround a bug in older Python versions such as 2.7.3. See
<https://bugs.python.org/issue6972> and specifically the fix at
<https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/0c5fa35c9f12#l3.11>.

Local Modifications:
Renamed zipfile.py to zipfile_2_7_13.py to avoid conflicting with system copy.
